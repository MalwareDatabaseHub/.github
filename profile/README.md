# Welcome to the Malware Database Hub!

## About us

We are the **Malware Database Hub**, a collective effort dedicated to preserving malware samples for educational purposes and cybersecurity analysis.

Our goal is to provide a centralized place where malware samples can be accessed for testing, reverse engineering, and learning.

## What do we do?

At the Malware Database Hub, we currently:

- Fork malware databases on GitHub for preservation and research.

In the future, we plan to:

- Create our own databases featuring malware not available in commonly known repositories.

We do not:

- Encourage illegal or unethical use of malware in any way.

## Contributing to the Malware Database Hub

Contributions are warmly welcomed. Please make sure your contributions follow the GitHub Terms of Service (ToS).
For better documentation, we kindly ask contributors to include the malware source whenever possible.

Have fun!
