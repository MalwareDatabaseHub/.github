# Migrated to Codeberg

We have officially migrated to Codeberg due to serious privacy concerns regarding Microsoft's use of GitHub repositories for AI training.

## Why We Migrated: Privacy & Security Concerns

### 1. Team Privacy Priorities

At MalwareDatabaseHub, protecting the privacy of our contributors, users, and the broader security research community is our highest priority. We believe that:

- **User data sovereignty matters**: Contributors should have full control over how their work and metadata are used
- **Consent is non-negotiable**: Data usage for AI training should require explicit, informed consent from all stakeholders
- **Privacy-first platforms align with our mission**: As a malware research organization, we understand the critical importance of data protection

### 2. Risks of Data Exposure Through AI Training

Microsoft's use of GitHub repositories for AI model training presents several concerning risks:

- **Unintended code exposure**: Even public repositories may contain sensitive patterns, methodologies, or research approaches that could be reconstructed through AI outputs
- **Metadata harvesting**: Commit messages, issue discussions, and contributor patterns reveal organizational workflows and security practices
- **Intellectual property concerns**: Original research and analysis techniques may be incorporated into commercial AI products without attribution or compensation
- **Security implications**: Malware analysis patterns and detection signatures could be learned and potentially exploited by malicious actors through AI-generated code

### 3. Lack of User Control Over Data Usage

The current GitHub/Microsoft approach to AI training lacks adequate user control:

- **Opt-out limitations**: While some opt-out mechanisms exist, they are incomplete and difficult to verify
- **Retroactive data use**: Historical repository data may have already been incorporated into training datasets
- **Third-party access**: Uncertainty about which Microsoft services and partners may access repository data for AI purposes
- **Terms of service changes**: Unilateral policy updates that expand data usage rights without meaningful user recourse

### 4. Our Commitment to Security and Transparency

By migrating to Codeberg, we are demonstrating our commitment to:

- **Community-driven governance**: Codeberg is operated by a non-profit organization focused on user rights
- **Transparent data policies**: Clear, straightforward terms that respect contributor privacy
- **No AI training**: Codeberg does not use repository data for training commercial AI models
- **GDPR compliance**: Strong European data protection standards that prioritize user privacy
- **Open source values**: Supporting platforms that align with free software principles and community autonomy

## Moving Forward

We apologize for any inconvenience this migration may cause, but we believe it's essential to maintain the trust and security our community deserves. All repositories, issues, and documentation have been transferred to our new Codeberg organization.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
